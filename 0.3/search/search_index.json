You can use the same data definition formats as in the <code>Vizzu</code> library, but you must add the entire data set for the whole story in the initial step; you can not change this later.

A slide can be a single chart corresponding to a single animate call from <code>Vizzu</code>. Or a slide can be a sequence of animation calls, in which case all of these animations will be played until the last one in the sequence, allowing for more complex transitions between slides. Navigation controls beneath the chart will navigate between the slides. You can use the <code>PgUp</code> and <code>PgDn</code> buttons, left and right arrows to navigate between slides, and the <code>Home</code> and <code>End</code> buttons to jump to the first or last slide.</p> <pre><code>const slides = [{\n    config: {\n        x: 'Foo',\n        y: 'Bar'\n    }\n}, {\n    config: {\n        color: 'Foo',\n        x: 'Baz',\n        geometry: 'circle'\n    }\n}]</code></pre> <p>On each chart, you can define the chart configuration and style with the same objects as in <code>Vizzu</code>.
