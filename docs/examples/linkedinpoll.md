# Presentation Poll Results

In August, 2022, we asked data scientists in 5 LinkedIn groups about how often
they have to present the results of their analysis to business stakeholders.
This is a data story about the results of that poll.

<vizzu-player controller></vizzu-player>

<script type="module" src="./main.js"></script>

Create a `vizzu-player` element that will contain the rendered story.

```
<vizzu-player controller></vizzu-player>
```

In a script module element:

```javascript
// {% include "./linkedinpoll/main.js" %}
```
