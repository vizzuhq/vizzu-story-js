This was one of the questions in the

<vizzu-player controller></vizzu-player>

<script type="module" src="./main.js"></script>

Create a `vizzu-player` element that will contain the rendered story.

```
<vizzu-player controller></vizzu-player>
```

In a script module element:

```js
// {% include "./proglangs/main.js" %}
```
